0	 Blockstate Security Token Offering — Tokenized assets market place 	" 21 June 2019	"	https://www.inwara.com/blockslate-security-token-offering-tokenized-assets-market	Switzerland-based online marketplace for tokenized securities and other assets — Blockstate has launched their Pre-sale token offering on 18th June and following the conclusion of its pre-sale, Blockslate is all set to launch its Security Token Offering on 25th June, according to InWara’s Market Intelligence Platform.Last month, Security Token Offerings from across the globe raised a whopping $265 million with the US leading the charge. Not just in the STO space, but also in terms of other fundraising mechanisms like ICOs and IEOs.InWara’s Monthly Report: May 2019Like our data? You'll love our market intelligence platform Get startedBlockslate was founded in April 2018 by Michale Weber and Pual Claudius — Blockslate views itself as a security token platform for “non-bankable” assets such as real estate, debt or even SME equity. Blockstate argues that 54% of the global assets are not easily investable and intends to rattle the metaphorical cage of the global financial ecosystem.So what exactly are tokenized assets?Tokenization of real-world assets is the latest trend in the Blockchain and crypto space — anything from real estate to paintings are being tokenized. But what does tokenization of assets exactly mean?It’s as simple as taking a real-world asset and issuing digital tokens that each represent a small part of that asset. For example — Imagine you have a painting worth $2 million, you can tokenize the asset by issuing say 2 million tokens (the number is arbitrary), so now each token represents a 0.00005% stake in that property.To know more about security token and STOs, check out InWara's Security Token Offering report.Now if you’ve ever bought or sold certain assets like real estate or fine art for example, you know it’s not easy. Assets classes like real estate are low-liquidity because they’re not easily tradeable. On top of this fractional ownership of these assets wasn’t previously possible — you can’t sell 10% of a house or 10% of a painting and you if you can’t sell 10% of an asset then you definitely can’t trade them on a secondary market.	https://www.inwara.com/images/123images/001may1.png 
1	 Bitcoin Oil — A PoS hardfork of Bitcoin network to launch ICO 	" 21 June 2019	"	https://www.inwara.com/bitcoin-oil-pos-hardfork-bitcoin-network-ico	Bitcoin and Oil — arguably two of the most valuable assets in the world right now but have you heard of Bitcoin Oil? No, it’s not a new hybrid asset class — it’s the official name of a new Hard Fork from Bitcoin’s main network. According to InWara’s Martel Intelligence Platform, Bitcoin OIL has officially launched its Initial Coin Offering on June 19th with a Main sale hardcap of a whopping $102 million.Is a setting a MainSale Hardcap amount of over a $100 million a bit too ambitious? Average funds raisedInWara’s Monthly Report: May 2019 Like our data? You'll love our market intelligence platform Get started The graph depicts the average funds raised through various fundraising methods — ICO projects managed to raise just $10 million on average, which is 1/10th the hardcap amount set by Bitcoin Oil.But notably, Bitcoin Oil has an incredible technical team working on the project — from Andrew Dubinsky (CTO) who has 20+ years of experience founding and scaling tech startups to multimillion-dollar companies, to Rajesh Kumar Radhakrishna (Chief Software Architect) who is a digital solution’s architect with expertise in Blockchain and AI. Hailing from Switzerland — Bitcoin Oil is the latest PoS hardfork that aims to bring about a whole host of changes that has been long overdue for the original Bitcoin Network. The company aims to achieve this using improvements based on the “Optimally Improved Ledger” or OIL technology.What does Bitcoin OIL plan on achieving through this hardfork and further development?The main agenda is providing solutions to enable mass adoption of Bitcoin — currently, there’s just over a million daily active Bitcoin users which is a far cry from being a global p2p payment system. For example, there are more than 1.5 billion credit cards in the US alone or more than 67% of the population. Bitcoin Oil plans on completely abandoning BIP procedures which have made rapid changes to the original Bitcoin network incredibly difficult but instead has simple and straight forward agreements in place with some of the largest Blockchain development companies to make things as smooth as possible.	https://www.inwara.com/images/123images/001may2.png

At the heart of the envisioned content economy is its native crypto token dubbed VERA. The platform gives not just content creators a better deal but also content viewers to earn crypto tokens as a reward. Their platform also enables content creators to expand their channel through crowdfunding — giving more power to creators. Since it’s ICO, Verasity has come a long way in developing its platform’s capabilities — notably, getting integrated into already existing channels such as Vimeo, The Game streaming service Twitch and even Youtube. Here’s the roadmap of VerasityInWara’s Market Intelligence PlatformAccording to Verasity’s roadmap — the company is expected to scale its Verawallet platform to 15 million users.This business model is interesting because previous ad revenue based models like Youtube don’t incentivize it’s content consumers with rewards. Often people are annoyed with the barrage of ads they come across on platforms — prompting consumers to buy premium versions. But if consumers are rewarded for watching ads? Maybe watching a few ads could become bearable.	https://www.inwara.com/images/123images/001may7.png https://www.inwara.com/images/pasted_image_0.png

On the HARA data-exchange, participants are encouraged to submit and acquire data through a robust incentive system that empowers every participant to engage in mutually beneficial interactions.Their mission began within the agriculture and food sector and continues toward overall sustainability for the world’s most socially impactful sectors like health, education, mobility, and recreation sectors.Since 2015, HARA has been developing its own mobile application, dashboard, and data collection model for smallholder farmers. In Indonesia, they have already made valuable agricultural data available to several key industry partners, enabling them to expand their offerings to thousands of farmers and others parties working in the supply chain.HARA received InWara’s Data Transparency Grading (DTG) certificate and was given a ‘AA’ grade, which is akin to a fill rate of disclosed data above 85%.From this grading, it can be drawn that ICO/STOs that have a high DTG grading are showcasing valuable information to the investors, which could be quintessential in determining the company’s success and such a grading would likely put them at an advantage compared to other companies.Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) swiftly gained popularity as an alternative way to raise capital, among entrepreneurs and established companies alike. ICOs were essentially easier to conduct and allowed founders to expand to a global network of retail and professional investors. Despite this overwhelming popularity, many ICO/STOs fail to reveal critical data about their project, leaving investors no option but to speculate about returns on their investments.SourceIn light of this, the lack of a regulatory framework in the crypto marketspace quickly became the reason for the downfall of ICOs as millions were siphoned by bad actors in the market space. The multitude of scams in the industry has made investors wary in Blockchain and akin technologies, swiftly gaining notoriety. The next progressive step forward is to bridge the information gap between investors and startups by encouraging a spirit of trust and transparency between them. As a harbinger of this radical new sentiment InWara, an independent research-house, provides a factual and data-driven analysis of all concluded, upcoming and active ICOs/STOs in the market space.InWara’s analysis of Blockchain and akin enterprises are represented in a straight-forward coherent manner and is monikered as a Data Transparency Grading (DTG) certificate.To get your project graded contact us at InWara.comInWara aggregates the disorganized data published by startups, verifies it and then proceeds to bring structure into the clutter of information by categorizing it into four main categories.For a more in-depth understanding of the methodology behind the grading, check out InWara’s article.No. of companies in Singapore in the top 6 sectorsSourceHARA Technology pte ltd is a Swiss- based company belonging to the Technology sector.

It has crypto friendly rules and regulations and wide-scale adoption of blockchain technologies. The country have even being monikered as the ‘Crypto hub of South-East Asia’.One among the important occasions was when The Monetary association of Singapore welcomed entrepreneurs and visionaries of crypto space, to the Singapore Consensus-2018.In the Technology sector, a commendable 224 companies have passed the minimum requirements to attain a DTG grading.Out of this, a meager 0.89% of ICO/STOs having a fill rate of disclosed data above 85%, which translates to ‘AA’ grading. The overall grading average, in this case is 1.33%.Following this is a 32.59% of ICO/STOs having a fill rate of disclosed data between 75–85%, which translates to ‘A’ grading, the overall grading average, in this case being 35.5%.Likewise, 17.85% of the ICO/STOs have a fill rate of disclosed data between 65–75%, which translates to ‘BA’ grading. The overall grading average, in this case, is slightly higher at 22.04%.Hence, a trend can be drawn that the Technology, has a moderate number of ICO/STOs that are transparent with their data. It is important to consider that companies with good disclosure habits, tend to work more honestly and perform better.Read our Monthly Report: February 2019 to stay in the crypto-loop.	https://www.inwara.com/images/image1.png https://www.inwara.com/images/image1.png https://www.inwara.com/images/image31.png https://www.inwara.com/images/image2.png

The Main Sale soft cap for its token sale its $20 million and the Main Sale hard cap is set for a whopping $70 million, ambitious to say the least. Only 60% of the total 12 billion TAL tokens will be available for sale during it’s ICO. The token distribution of Talentico ICO is also vague and generalized with 25% going towards the team and 15% going towards community development reserve.Overall, Talentico aims to achieve some very ambitious goals and has purportedly onboarded quite a talented team but is very vague about a lot of important details from its Raodmap to the Fund Allocation.	https://www.inwara.com/images/xxtalentico11.png https://www.inwara.com/images/xxtalentico21.png
